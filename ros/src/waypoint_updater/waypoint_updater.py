Notes from project lesson : 
===========================

This package contains the waypoint updater node: waypoint_updater.py. The purpose of this node is to update the target velocity property of each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacle detection data. This node will subscribe to the /base_waypoints, /current_pose, /obstacle_waypoint, and /traffic_waypoint topics, and publish a list of waypoints ahead of the car with target velocities to the /final_waypoints topic.

Suggested Order of Project Development
=======================================
Because you will be writing code across several packages with some nodes depending on messages published by other nodes, we suggest completing the project in the following order:

1. Waypoint Updater Node (Partial): Complete a partial waypoint updater which subscribes to /base_waypoints and /current_pose and publishes to /final_waypoints.

The /base_waypoints topic publishes a list of all waypoints for the track, so this list includes waypoints both before and after the vehicle (note that the publisher for /base_waypoints publishes only once). For this step in the project, the list published to /final_waypoints should include just a fixed number of waypoints currently ahead of the vehicle:

The first waypoint in the list published to /final_waypoints should be the first waypoint that is currently ahead of the car.
The total number of waypoints ahead of the vehicle that should be included in the /final_waypoints list is provided by the LOOKAHEAD_WPS variable in waypoint_updater.py.

We can see that both the /final_waypoints and /base_waypoints topics have message type Lane. You can look at the details about this message type in <path_to_project_repo>/ros/src/styx_msgs/msg/.

message type being used in /final_waypoints:

Type: styx_msgs/Lane

provides the following message information:

std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
styx_msgs/Waypoint[] waypoints
  geometry_msgs/PoseStamped pose
    std_msgs/Header header
      uint32 seq
      time stamp
      string frame_id
    geometry_msgs/Pose pose
      geometry_msgs/Point position
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
      geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
        float64 w
  geometry_msgs/TwistStamped twist
    std_msgs/Header header
      uint32 seq
      time stamp
      string frame_id
    geometry_msgs/Twist twist
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z

From here you can see that the messages contain a header and a Waypoint list named waypoints. Each waypoint has pose and twist data. Going further, you can see that twist.twist data contains 3D linear and angular velocities.

Lane message example
=====================
As a use-case example, given a single styx_msgs/Lane message my_lane_msg, you can access the x direction linear velocity of the first waypoint in Python with:

my_lane_msg[0].twist.twist.linear.x
Note that the coordinates for linear velocity are vehicle-centered, so only the x-direction linear velocity should be nonzero.

4. Waypoint Updater (Full): Use /traffic_waypoint to change the waypoint target velocities before publishing to /final_waypoints. Your car should now stop at red traffic lights and move when they are green.

import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped
from styx_msgs.msg import Lane, Waypoint

This node will publish waypoints from the car's current position to some `x` distance ahead.

As mentioned in the doc, you should ideally first implement a version which does not care
about traffic lights or obstacles.

Once you have created dbw_node, you will update this node to use the status of traffic lights too.

Please note that our simulator also provides the exact location of traffic lights and their
current status in `/vehicle/traffic_lights` message. You can use this message to build this node
as well as to verify your TL classifier.

TODO (for Yousuf and Aaron): Stopline location for each traffic light.
